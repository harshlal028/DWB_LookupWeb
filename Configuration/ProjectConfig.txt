STEPS:
1) Import Code in Eclipse as "Existing Project in Workspace"
2) Add the Jars provided in the project build path
3) Configure Jboss 7.1 with the config file provided in eclipse.
4) Add the jboss hornetq client in build path
5) Right click -> properties -> Deployment assembly. Add all newly added Java Build path entries here.
6) Configure Mysql and add its connection in eclipse.
7) Configure Jboss 7.1 and provide the hostname of your System
8) Deploy the resource on Jboss server.
9) You can access project using http://<SystemIp>:8080/LookupWeb/

======OR=======
1) I have provided a WAR file of the same code. Just deploy the WAR on Jboss 7.1 with the configuration file "standalone-full-ha.xml" provided in the "Lookup\Configuration\Jboss 7.1 config" folder.
To do this perform the following steps:
a) Navigate to "\jboss-as-7.1.0.Final\standalone\configuration"
b) Paste the file "standalone-full-ha.xml" provided in the "Lookup\Configuration\Jboss 7.1 config" folder to the path in step b.
c) Navigate to "\jboss-as-7.1.0.Final\standalone\deployments"
d) Copy "LookupWeb.War in the above folder and create file "LookupWeb.war.dodeploy"
e) Navigate to "jboss-as-7.1.0.Final\bin"
f) Run the following command
standalone.bat -c standalone-full-ha.xml -b <YourSystemIp>

2) Then you may run queries using REST client like POSTMAN or SoapUI.
